<li><h2><a href="/posts/Japanese-language-learn/">Japanese Language Learn</a></h2>
    <p><p>I am learning Japanese and decided to make an application for it.
For now, it's just a desktop application as that's the easiest way to use.
Check it out <a href="https://github.com/libka-b/japanese-language-learn/tree/main">here</a>
and join me in learning or development or both!</p>

<li><h2><a href="/posts/Crafting-Interpreters-in-Kotlin/">Crafting Interpreters in Kotlin</a></h2>
    <p><p>Working as a software engineer, I was surprised how often there comes a need to interpret something and the code for that is a mini interpreter. But it makes sense, teams often work with data and need to evaluate them somehow and since the data is very specific to their domain, they need to use something very tailored. Last time this happened, I opened my copy of <a href="https://craftinginterpreters.com/">Crafting Interpreters</a> this time for the third time and using third different language and determined that this time I would finally see it through. And this time I did and there were several fascinating concepts I learnt and want to highlight some of those.</p>

<li><h2><a href="/posts/Kover-Kotlin-code-coverage/">Kover Kotlin code coverage</a></h2>
    <p><p>I am working on a Kotlin project that has lot of branching in the code and as such it's difficult to even estimate which parts are covered by unit tests and which parts are missing. The task at hand was to find a tool that would generate test coverage report for me and ideally would be configurable and plugable into the CI pipeline. I was aware of <a href="https://github.com/jacoco/jacoco">JaCoCo</a> but had bad experience with it, as it mingles the generated bytecode and can break some libraries. Instead, I searched a novel approach, and found <a href="https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx-kover">kotlinx-kover</a> developed by JetBrains.</p>

<li><h2><a href="/posts/Migrating-Jekyll-blog-Eleventy/">Migrating Jekyll blog to Eleventy</a></h2>
    <p><p>I decided to migrate my Jekyll based blog to another static site generator based one. My eyes were first on <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> but I found it overly complicated with little explanations. My next option was <a href="https://www.11ty.dev">Eleventy</a> with its great in-depth tutorial. Here, I won't be describing my step by step process to migrating rather I will focus on differences and the overall experience.</p>

<li><h2><a href="/posts/Using-Javacript-to-avoid-clicking/">Using Javascript to avoid clicking</a></h2>
    <p><p>Recently, I had to check hundreds of checkboxes to proceed with my work and the website didn't expose any API that I could leverage to make my life easier. Being a proper lazy developer who doesn't want to click hundreds of times using mouse and potentially missing some of the buttons, I got an idea involving Javascript and developer console.</p>

<li><h2><a href="/posts/Learning-Kotlin-as-Python-developer/">Learning Kotlin as Python developer</a></h2>
    <p><p>After 7 years working as a Python developer, I started a new job working primarily with Kotlin. Here, I'll share the experience and some ways the two languages differ. Let's take a look.</p>
</p>

<li><h2><a href="/posts/Git-Cheatsheet/">Git Cheatsheet</a></h2>
    <p><p>It just recently happened to me that I wanted to do something in git,
I knew exactly what but was unable to remember the git command
that would do that. So I decided to make this blog, mainly for me,
to keep all my favorite git commands and workflows in a single place.
But if someone else finds this useful it would be great.</p>

<li><h2><a href="/posts/Use-PDB-over-print/">Use PDB over print</a></h2>
    <p><p>When I started coding in python, whenever my script crashed with some traceback,
I would start adding <code>print</code>s here and there and would re-run the script as many
times as needed to figure out what's wrong. Now, this approach works, but takes
a lot of time and may be quite frustrating (Where should I put prints? What should
I print?).</p>
</p>
</li>

<li><h2><a href="/posts/Mypy-generics-and-subtypes/">Mypy generics and subtypes</a></h2>
    <p><p>Type <code>Optional[bool]</code> can be one of three values - <code>None</code>, <code>True</code> or <code>False</code>.
Type <code>bool</code> can be one of <code>True</code> or <code>False</code>. So we can easily say that
<code>bool</code> is subtype of <code>Optional[bool]</code>, right? Let's see what happens when
we start nesting these types.</p>
